# How to Contribute

## 1. Issue First

**Do not submit a Pull Request without an associated Issue.** If you have an idea for a feature or have found a bug, please [open an issue](https://github.com/SL-Pirate/dart_odbc/issues) first to discuss it. This ensures:
-   The change aligns with the project's goals.
-   You aren't working on something already being handled by someone else.
-   We agree on the implementation approach before you spend time coding.

## 2. Modular PRs
Keep PRs **small and focused**.
-   One PR = One Feature/Fix.
-   Do not bundle unrelated changes, metadata files, or style updates into a single PR.
-   PRs that change dozens of files for a single "helper function" will be closed without review.

## 3. Ethical Use of AI
While AI tools can assist in writing code, **you are responsible for every line you submit.** Do not submit unsupervised AI output.
-   If it is clear that you have not manually validated, tested, or understood the code you are pushing, the PR will be rejected.
-   We value human-curated contributions that respect the project's existing structure and logic.
